Roadmap:

I won't extend the roadmap more than 1 minor version beyond the WIP branch, features planned beyond that will go in planned features

If there is a current target major build it will appear at the top of this file, 

Patches (0.0.x) will be tagged on github and recorded in here

Minor versions (0.x.0) will have a [thematic name] and a summary of the direction taken since the last minor version at the top of the patch notes, these will always include a document() run in the final commit

Major versions (x.0.0) will appear at the top of this document if they are a current target

	All functionality ported over (done)
    
	Successful roxygen compile and install
	
	Add subdivisions to bulk processor

	  Decile_distribution
	  Pollutant_distribution
	  City_histogram
	  City_freq

0.0.3 (uploaded 7/6/22)

  stat_wrangler
    calculates the flat and % differences between specified deciles
    complete and fully functional
	
	Renamed the long IMD decile column to IMD within create_prawns

0.0.4 (uploaded 8/6/22)

	Ported decile_vs_emission_by_variable into the package
    Corrected the issue arising from IMD as a factor
    
  A new and exciting error in the NOx emissions with trend lines
    
0.1.0 (Uploaded 8/6/22)
	
	[Spooky scary skeletons] Created the basic functionality that gives a standardised framework for building on

	create_prawns (complete)
		Reads the shapefile and creates the PRAWNS object as a csv file
	 	Porting from an old project of mine where it's a collection of scripts
		Fully self contained
		-The input files for national statistics can't be changed in the function call

	city_summary
		Creates a single page spread of graphs providing information on a geographic area identified by variables in the function input
		Porting from an old project where it's a collection of scripts
		Requires a PRAWNS csv file for easy operation as this lets me standerdise the input
		
	stat_wrangler (complete)
	  Calculates the flat and % difference between the mean and median points for deciles
	  Calculates the flat and % difference between the intercept of the regrassion lines plotted for all data and the median for each        decile

	Updated the readme to be much better

	Ported in the faceted graph and improved it with an ifelse statement for city vs county/ua

0.2.0 (Uploaded 10/6/22)
	
	[Night of the functional scripts] Recreated all scripts from the alpha as functions compatible with the prawns framework

	Ported in the average decile vs emissions for areas function

	Completed porting in all existing functionality as functions

0.2.1 (Uploaded 16/6/22)

	Created faceted_sources, got it functional

	Trimmed excess variables from create_prawns

	Began work on bulk_processor

	Began work on source_summary

	Renamed city_processor to area_processor to reflect the added functionality

0.2.2 (Uploaded 16/6/22)

	Completed source_summary

	Completed bulk processor

0.2.3 (Uploaded 16/6/22)

	Added basic documentation for all functions

	Removed some artifacts

0.3.0 (Uploaded 17/6/22)
	
	[Stylish spectres] Many quality of life updates and removal of artifacts from the code, aiming to make a decent end user experience by improving presentation

	Basic documentation for all functions
	
	Made the easy quality of life updates
		Improved labels for RUC inequality plot
		Fixed some output label typos

0.3.1 (Uploaded 17/6/22)
	
	Got a succesful compile

	Got a londonless summary in a subfolder of the bulk processor

0.3.2 (Uploaded 17/6/22)

0.4.0 (Uploaded 21/6/22)

	[The vivisection] Functions upgraded to pick out bits within the data

	bulk_processor upgrades:
		creates a subfolder with london excluded (0.3.1)
		creates a subfolder where na=0 (0.3.2)

	stat_wrangler upgrades:
		works out the differences for all sources (0.3.5)

	gradient_pie

0.5.0

	[Forbidden knowlege] Vignettes for the primary functions completed, formulas specified to clip out the warnings

	Modularity in decile vs emission by variable if UK average used

Planned features:
