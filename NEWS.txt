Roadmap:

I won't extend the roadmap more than 1 minor version beyond the WIP branch, features planned beyond that will go in planned features

If there is a current target major build it will appear at the top of this file, 

Patches (0.0.x) will be tagged on github and recorded in here

Minor versions (0.x.0) will have a [thematic name] and a summary of the direction taken since the last minor version at the top of the patch notes, these will always include a document() run in the final commit

Major versions (x.0.0) will appear at the top of this document if they are a current target
