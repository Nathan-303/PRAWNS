	Successful roxygen compile and install
	
	Add subdivisions to bulk processor
		results without london
		results with NA values set to 0
	
	Improve clarity of labels on source breakdown

	A function that makes a folder with all the results saved in it

	A lovely readme that has vignettes for every function

	Extend differnce between deciles to cover all sources if the option is selected

0.3.0 (WIP)

	bulk_processor working as intended

	
	
0.0.1 (uploaded 6/6/22)

  create_prawns works
  
  data source for city_summary works
  
0.0.2 (uploaded 6/6/22)  
	
	got the following graphs working in city_summary
	  Decile_distribution
	  Pollutant_distribution
	  City_histogram
	  City_freq

0.0.3 (uploaded 7/6/22)

  stat_wrangler
    calculates the flat and % differences between specified deciles
    complete and fully functional
	
	Renamed the long IMD decile column to IMD within create_prawns

0.0.4 (uploaded 8/6/22)

	Ported decile_vs_emission_by_variable into the package
    Corrected the issue arising from IMD as a factor
    
  A new and exciting error in the NOx emissions with trend lines
    
0.1.0 (Uploaded 8/6/22)

	create_prawns (complete)
		Reads the shapefile and creates the PRAWNS object as a csv file
	 	Porting from an old project of mine where it's a collection of scripts
		Fully self contained
		-The input files for national statistics can't be changed in the function call

	city_summary
		Creates a single page spread of graphs providing information on a geographic area identified by variables in the function input
		Porting from an old project where it's a collection of scripts
		Requires a PRAWNS csv file for easy operation as this lets me standerdise the input
		
	stat_wrangler (complete)
	  Calculates the flat and % difference between the mean and median points for deciles
	  Calculates the flat and % difference between the intercept of the regrassion lines plotted for all data and the median for each        decile

0.1.1 (Uploaded 8/6/22)
	
	Updated the readme to be much better

	Moved the changelogs to NEWS.txt  

0.1.2 (uploaded 9/6/22)

	Added linetype labelling to the source breakdown
  
0.1.3 (Uploaded 10/6/22)
	
	Made a function for looking at inequalities by RUC classification

0.1.4 (Uploaded 10/6/22)

	Ported in the faceted graph and improved it with an ifelse statement for city vs county/ua

0.2.0 (Uploaded 10/6/22)

	Ported in the average decile vs emissions for areas function

	Completed porting in all existing functionality as functions

0.2.1 (Uploaded 16/6/22)

	Created faceted_sources, got it functional

	Trimmed excess variables from create_prawns

	Began work on bulk_processor

	Began work on source_summary

	Renamed city_processor to area_processor to reflect the added functionality

0.2.3 (Uploaded 16/6/22)

	Completed source_summary

	Completed bulk processor

0.3.0 

	Documentation for all functions working

	Make the easy quality of life updates
	
Planned features:

	Accepts data from TIF format (relevant for modelled data from some sources)
	
	Averages with and without london tracked against the city
	
	Each graph function within summary can be called separately


QOL updates:

	rename the legend titles for RUC_IMD()

	add uk average to the faceted graph	

	add variable descriptons to decile vs emission by variable

	add documantation to source_summary

	add documentation to faceted_summary
